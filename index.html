                <p>The map on the left shows the different commodities around the country.
                    Each of these commodities vary in price depending on what region they are in. 
                    The Map aims to show the range of commodities and their prices and whether they can be targeted by the 
                    campaign managers to try win votes on these regions.
                </p>
                <p>The size of each green circle on the map shows how much
                    it costs in that regions. The bigger the size, the much expensive the product is in that region. 
                    Many factors can contribute to the increase of prices in these region. They include scarcity of that product in that region,
                    physically challenging to bring in those coomodities to remote neigbourhoods,etc.
                </p>
                <P>
                    These challenging factors can be used to promote a campaign around the regions and identify the most basic needs that
                    need to be addressed. Certainly the candidate that can achieve address this issue will most ptobably get the voters votes
                    of that region.

                <p>The graph on the right shows the different regions and their registered voters.
                    This can be used to identify which regions have the highest registered voters and each campaign manager
                    can use it to target those first before mvoing on to the less registered regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This therefore shows how politicians can use regions and their weaknesses to gain voters confidence and onec elected
                    those same regions go back to struggling with the commodities. Typically politicians would initially solve the problem
                    only for them to stop once the election has ended. This remains one of the biggest strategy used by kenyan politicians 
                    and has come under a lot of critiscm  in the last 5 years.
